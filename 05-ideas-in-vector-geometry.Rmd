# Advanced Ideas in Vector Geometry

In this chapter you will be introduced to the geometry of vectors and vector operations. It is important to recognize that although the illustration of these ideas is restricted to 2-dimensional space, all of these ideas can be extended to *n*-dimensions. 



```{r create_graph_paper, echo=FALSE}
x = data.frame(x = -15:15) 
y = data.frame(y = -15:15)
fake_graph = tidyr::crossing(x, y)

graph_paper = ggplot(data = fake_graph, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0) +
  theme_light() +
  scale_x_continuous(name ="", breaks = -15:15, labels = NULL, expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "", breaks = -15:15, labels = NULL, expand = c(0, 0)) +
  geom_segment(
    x = 0, xend = 0, y = 15, yend = -15, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.02, "npc"), end = "both", type = "closed")
    ) +
  geom_segment(
    x = -15, xend = 15, y = 0, yend = 0, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.02, "npc"), end = "both", type = "closed")
    ) +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_line(color = "#60CDE4"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```
