# Foreword

Spring 2021. 

The contents of this book constitute information from several set of notes from a variety of QME courses, including from an old course called EPsy 8269. We are making this book available as a resource for anyone who wants to use it. We will be adding and revising the content for awhile. Feel free to offer criticism, suggestion, and feedback. You can either [open an issue](https://github.com/zief0002/matrix-algebra/issues) on the book's github page or [send us an email](mailto: zief0002@umn.edu) directly.
